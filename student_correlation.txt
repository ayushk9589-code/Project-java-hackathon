ID,Correlation(attendance_vs_marks_across_subjects)This project checks whether attendance and marks move together for each student (subject-wise).
We calculate correlation r, which is always between -1 and +1.
If r is close to +1: higher attendance usually means higher marks (strong positive link).
If r is close to -1: higher attendance usually means lower marks (strong negative link).
If r is near 0: attendance is not a reliable predictor of marks (weak/no linear link).
Bottom line: r tells the direction and strength of the linear relationship—no guessing, only numbers.
